# MyReads Project

This project allows the user to find new books on the search page and sort selected books into three categories, Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read. To launch the project, make sure you are connected to the internet and run "npm install" and "npm start" from the terminal. You can use the green arrows on the book thumbnail to change the categories of each book. You can also search for books by selecting the green addition symbol on the bottom right of the screen.
